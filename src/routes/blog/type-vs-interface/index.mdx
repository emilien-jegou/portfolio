In typescript, we often use `interface` and `type` intercheangably, we tend to favorise `type` as they represent a higher subset of features, e.g. you can represent inheritacne with both interface and types but only with the second can you perform type mapping e.g. `Partial` or `Omit`.

It seems only logical that if you have two almost identical solution you would choose the more feature-full option, especially when it’s syntax is also generally shorter. But in truth there are things that only interfaces can do:

## "This" keyword

Using interfaces allow the use of the `this` keyword which can help shorten methods chaining and improve clarity e.g.:
<BlogCode language="typescript">
```typescript
interface MyChain<A, B, C, D> {
   chainA(a: A): this;
   chainB(b: B): this;
   chainC(b: C): this;
   chainD(b: D): this;
   execute(): My;
}

// You cannot use the "this" keywords in type.
type MyChain<A, B, C, D> = {
   chainA(a: A): MyComplexBuilder<A, B, C, D>;
   chainB(b: B): MyComplexBuilder<A, B, C, D>;
   chainC(b: C): MyComplexBuilder<A, B, C, D>;
   chainD(b: D): MyComplexBuilder<A, B, C, D>;
   execute(): My;
}
```
</BlogCode>

## Declaration merging

Declaration merging is a feature that allow multiple interface in the same scope to "merge" implicitely, e.g.:
<BlogCode language="typescript">
```typescript
interface MyInterface {
    age: number;
}

interface MyInterface {
    name: string;
}

const x: MyInterface = { age: 123, name: 'John Doe' }
```
</BlogCode>

This is a feature that is rarely used by developers for a few reason:
- it doesn’t work well with LSP or typescript
- it makes your code harder to navigate
- it’s kinda comfusing and could be bug-inducing

Yet there is one use case where declaration merging becomes a valid option: when you wish to extends external interfaces.

### On Typescript default

Declaration merging can be used to extends global types in your application:

<BlogCode language="typescript">
```typescript
interface Window {
  myAppVersion: string;
}

window.myAppVersion = "1.2.3";
```
</BlogCode>

This is the core of what the library `ts-reset` does for improving the standard
library type-safety, and it does so without plugins, but with a single import:
<BlogCode language="typescript">
```typescript
import '@total-typescript/ts-reset'
```
</BlogCode>

### On external libraries

The same principles can be used to extends external libraries in module files; it can help you avoid
adapters, proxies or implicit casting in your code.

<BlogCode language="typescript">
```typescript
// global.d.ts or in a module augmentation block
declare module 'express' {
  interface Request {
    user?: { id: string; role: string };
  }
}
```
</BlogCode>

If you declare your external interfaces as `type`'s in your application 3rd
party user will not be able to extend them in the same manner.

If your package has weak typing (e.g. overly resort to “any” or “unknown” on
external interface). Your users could then resort to declaration merging for
covering your type declaration as a palliative solution.

## So which one should I use?

> Should I use `interface` unless I need `type` features or use `type` unless I need `interface` features?

In general you will need `type`-only features more often than you will need the `interface`-only one, so I would recommend making it the default choice.

You can still use interface for inheritance and having access to the `this` keyword when it simplify your types. You will rarely encounter cases where declaration merging can be usefull, only when encountering third-party cases such as the one presented above, so don't focus on it too much.

Other than that, you may feel more comfortable using interface when coding in OOP, since it's meaning is deeply ingrained, and that's perfectly fine too.
